# Decoder_Ring_Thinkful

## Overview
I would build an application that would encode or decode messages. This project would allow me to apply what I learned about coding and unit testing with Mocha & Chai

## Challenge
I was tested on my ability to create complex algorithms as well as write test units with Mocha & Chai to test my algorithms.I was also expected to use expect() method to test my codes. 

## What I have learned
This project was challenging because I had to develop three algorithms for Caesar Shift, Polyibus Square, and Subsitution Cipher. This pushed me to think outside of the box. Nevertheless it was a great way to show what I've learned about unit testing.

## Technologies
1. JavaScript
2. Mocha
3. Chai
